# Mern Stack Template

>>> For Building Quick MERN Stack Websites 

## Quick Start

 This template uses MongoDB Atlas so you'll need to create an account with them and add your info in the config folder.
 Simple make the a file called default.json in the config folder and put in the following JSON (with your own info, of course)
```json
 {
 "mongoURI": "mongodb+srv://dbname:password123@test-account.mongodb.net/main?retryWrites=true",
 "jwtSecret" : "AnythinguWant"
 }
```
```bash
# Install server 
npm install

# Install client 
cd client
npm install

# Run both client and backend server at the same time
npm run dev

```
